# 👨‍⚕️Medical Doctor & Software Developer 👨‍💻

I’m a UK-based physician and self-taught programmer (#clinicianwhocodes) with a keen interest in the intersections of healthcare, technology, and data science. I use my skills in software development and my clinical experience to facilitate in-silico neuroinformatics research and to build websites/apps that improve the delivery of healthcare in the UK. 

🔬 **Primary Interests**: Neuroinformatics (i.e., connectomics), AI in healthcare, improving accessibility of medical careers

💻 **Tech Stack**: PHP (Laravel), Vue 3, TypeScript, Vite/Webpack, Popular CSS Frameworks, Python, MATLAB  

🌐 **Focus**: Website and app development

## 🩺 About Me

I'm exploring a career where clinical work and technology are balanced and combined. I want to use technology to develop solutions that are technically sound _and_ have clinical utility.
